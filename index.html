<p>Home to the iconic <b>Yellow Taxis</b>, <b>India's first metro railway network</b>, the <b>Eden Gardens</b>  and the <b>Salt Lake Stadium</b>, this vibrant metropolis was once the multicultural hub of India. However, through decades of corrupt State Politics and minimal support from the Central Government, this city is slowly eroding away to the sands of time - much like the many historic palatial buildings it houses.</p>
